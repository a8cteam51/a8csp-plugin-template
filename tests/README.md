# Tests

The test rig has four PHPUnit suites plus a Playwright end-to-end suite, run against wp-env
fixtures at three WordPress-version tiers.

## Suites

- **Unit** (`tests/Unit/`) — no WordPress, no wp-env. Runs against plain PHPUnit `TestCase` with
  recording `add_action()`/`add_filter()` stubs (`tests/Unit/wp-hook-stubs.php`) instead of Mockery
  or Brain Monkey, so the real `Plugin::boot()` loop is exercised outside WordPress.
  Fast, and part of `composer quality-check`.
- **Integration** (`tests/Integration/`) — boots inside wp-env against a supported WordPress
  version and exercises the plugin's real boot path. `UninstallTest` runs the real
  `uninstall.php` end-to-end (seeds sentinels, defines `WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN`, asserts its
  footprint is gone and a canary key survives) inside `#[RunInSeparateProcess]`, since that
  constant must not leak into the rest of the suite.
- **Requirements** (`tests/Integration/RequirementsCheckTest.php`, run as its own suite) — boots
  inside wp-env against a below-floor WordPress version to verify the requirements gate degrades
  gracefully instead of fataling.
- **Multisite** (`tests/Integration/MultisiteUninstallTest.php`, run as its own suite) — boots
  inside a wp-env fixture converted into a multisite network and proves `uninstall.php`'s options
  sweep cleans every site of the network, not just the site the uninstall runs on. The fixture is
  dedicated because `wp core multisite-convert` is one-way; the test self-skips when the
  Integration suite runs it against the single-site fixture.
- **End-to-End** (`tests/EndToEnd/`) — Playwright, driving a real browser against the dev wp-env
  instance.

## WooCommerce-less boot proof

`PluginBootWithoutWooCommerceTest` verifies the plugin-wide host gate: with WooCommerce inactive
the plugin stays un-booted and stages the "requires WooCommerce" notice instead of registering
anything. It self-skips whenever WooCommerce is active, so the proof needs WooCommerce deactivated
just for its run. One command does the whole dance, starting the tests wp-env instance first:

```sh
composer test:integration:no-wc
```

CI runs it as its own Tests job. `test:integration:no-wc` deactivates WooCommerce in the tests
wp-env instance, runs that one test directly with `--fail-on-skipped`, then reactivates
WooCommerce — failing when either the test or the reactivation fails — so the instance is left
ready for the Integration suite, and a run in which WooCommerce stayed active fails instead of
skipping. Its three steps are:

```sh
wp-env --config .wp-env.tests.json run cli wp plugin deactivate woocommerce
wp-env --config .wp-env.tests.json run cli --env-cwd=wp-content/plugins/a8csp-plugin-template vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=Integration --filter=PluginBootWithoutWooCommerceTest --fail-on-skipped
wp-env --config .wp-env.tests.json run cli wp plugin activate woocommerce
```

## Running the suites

Each of the wp-env-backed verbs — `test:integration`, `test:integration:no-wc`, `test:requirements`
and `test:multisite` — starts its own environment first: a container already running serves the
mount set it was created with, and `start` is what replaces it when the resolved config moved.
`test:unit` needs no container and starts none.

Unit (no wp-env required):

```sh
composer test:unit
```

Integration:

```sh
composer test:integration
npm run wp-env:tests:stop
```

Requirements:

```sh
composer test:requirements
npm run wp-env:belowfloor:stop
```

Multisite (its `afterStart` converts the fresh install into a subdirectory network):

```sh
composer test:multisite
npm run wp-env:multisite:stop
```

End-to-end (Playwright's `webServer` config starts the dev instance when none is running; stop it
with `npm run wp-env:stop`):

```sh
npm run test:e2e
```

## Ports

| Environment | Config                    | Port |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ---- |
| Dev / E2E   | `.wp-env.json`            | 8893 |
| Tests       | `.wp-env.tests.json`      | 8890 |
| Below-floor | `.wp-env.belowfloor.json` | 8891 |
| Multisite   | `.wp-env.multisite.json`  | 8892 |

Generated repositories get their own four-port block, derived from the repository name at
generation, so plugins started side by side don't contend for the same host ports. If two
environments still collide on one machine, wp-env's untracked override files take local
precedence (`.wp-env.override.json`; custom configs pair with e.g.
`.wp-env.tests.override.json`).

## Why plain `TestCase`, not `WP_UnitTestCase`

WordPress core's PHPUnit scaffold supports PHPUnit through version 9. This rig runs current
PHPUnit directly against plain `TestCase` inside wp-env, without depending on `WP_UnitTestCase`
or core's PHPUnit compatibility range.

That trade gives up `$this->factory` fixture helpers, `go_to()` routing simulation, and
`WP_UnitTestCase`'s per-test transaction rollback. The first two exist for content- and
query-heavy plugins exercising post/term/user fixtures and template routing — this scaffold's
Integration suite is narrower (boot path, requirements gating), so their absence costs little.
Without rollback, the database persists across tests, so each test cleans up what it writes.

## Mutation testing

`composer test:unit:mutation` runs Infection against the Unit suite's source. It sits outside the
default `composer quality-check` target (only `quality-check:all` pulls it in) and does not gate
pull requests — it runs on its own weekly schedule in CI (`.github/workflows/tests-mutation.yml`),
since mutation testing is slow.
