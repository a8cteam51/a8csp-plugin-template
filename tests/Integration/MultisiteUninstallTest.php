 * uninstall request runs on. Seeds the footprint's options on the main site and on a second site
 * created for the proof, runs the real `uninstall.php`, then asserts both sites come back clean
 * while a canary key survives on each.
 *
 * The proof is meaningful only on a converted network, so it self-skips in the standard
 * `composer test:integration` run (that fixture is single-site); `composer test:multisite` runs
 * it against the multisite fixture. It defines `WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN` by hand, so the test method
 * runs `#[RunInSeparateProcess]` for the same containment reason as `UninstallTest`.
