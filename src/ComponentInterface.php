 * time any hook can fire, every surviving component is fully initialized. A component may
 * therefore rely on its peers' readiness inside `register_hooks()` and hook callbacks, but never
 * inside `initialize()`.
 *
 * Each feature lives in its own folder under `src/` and exposes exactly one implementation of
 * this contract — its `Component` — as the feature's composition point; descriptive leaf classes
 * inside a feature keep their own names. The `Interface` suffix follows the PSR interface
 * convention (`ContainerInterface`, `LoggerInterface`) and frees the `Component` name for the
 * implementations that folder convention creates.
