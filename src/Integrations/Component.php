/**
 * The Integrations group root: one component that composes the plugin's optional integrations —
 * peers that extend the plugin when a companion plugin happens to be active.
 *
 * The children are full Components, and this parent forwards the pipeline's phases to them
 * faithfully through the shared `Components` collection: construction and readiness inside
 * `initialize()`, hooks inside `register_hooks()`. Children come in two shapes — a single-class
 * leaf with a descriptive name, and a grown sub-feature folder owning its own `Component`; a leaf
 * is promoted to the folder shape the day it needs a second class. This template nests exactly
 * one level; a plugin that finds itself wanting more is being told it has outgrown manual
 * composition — the authors' cue to consider a dependency injection container behind the
 * composition root, a judgment call that is theirs to make.
 *
 * The group's own gate stays at the base's always-open default because the children gate
 * individually; a gate every child shares — one companion they all require — would override
 * `is_needed()` here instead, sparing each child the repetition.
